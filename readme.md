YACardEmu
============

YACardEmu (*YetAnother*CardEmu) is a software emulator to emulate a range of magnetic card readers found in various arcade machines. Currently supported models are Sanwa CRP-1231BR-10, the CRP-1231LR-10NAB, and CR-S31R-10HS3 models which are commonly found in games such as Wangan Midnight Tune 3, Virtual-On Force, THE iDOLM@STER, F-Zero, Mario Kart, and Initial D series arcade cabinets.

Card images!
---------
Card images are now working! Place base images in a folder called `images` in the same folder as `YACardEmu.exe`, and the application will randomly choose one when the game calls to save. You'll see afterwards that a image will be placed in the same folder as your cards with your card name. The UI will also display this when picking a card. Enjoy.

Running
---------

You must have a USB to RS232 (or a physical serial port) connected to your machine. Configuration is made via both a `config.ini` file & via a web portal / API.
To access the web portal point your browser to `http://YOURIPHERE:8080/`, this web page is where you'll choose your card and insert your card.

Editing `config.ini` to point to where you want your cards stored is required.

Ubuntu

```
cp ../config.ini.sample config.ini
./YACardEmu
```

Windows

```
cd Release
YACardEmu.exe
```
