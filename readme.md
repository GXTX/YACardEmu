YACardEmu
============

YACardEmu (*YetAnother*CardEmu) is a program to emulate the Sanwa CRP-1231LR-10NAB card reader that's found on Wangan Midnight Tune 1, 2, 3, 3DX, and 3DX+ arcade machines by Namco. A longer goal of this project is to be compatible with similar models that line of readers (such as 1231BR).

Running
---------

You must have a USB to RS232 (or a physical serial port) connected to your machine. Configuration is made via both a `config.ini` file & via a web portal / API.
To access the web portal point your browser to `http://YOURIPHERE:8080/`, this web page is where you'll choose your card and insert your card.

Editing `config.ini` to point to where you want your cards stored is required.

Ubuntu

```
cp ../config.ini.sample config.ini
./YACardEmu
```

Windows

```
cd Release
YACardEmu.exe
